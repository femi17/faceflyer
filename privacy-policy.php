<p>Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain
ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs
to you stays yours.</p>
<p>When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Osahan

that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly
display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited
purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license
continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to
Osahan Deel Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been
provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the
scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights
to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.</p>
