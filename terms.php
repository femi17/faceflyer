<h3 class="h5 text-gray-800">2. Rewards Programs</h3>
</div>
<!-- End Title -->
<p>Overview The Company may offer one or more rewards programs (“Rewards Programs“) under which you may have the opportunity to earn Coin (in the faceflyer.com program, such Coin are called “FC“), which are redeemable for rewards (“Rewards“). The Company may limit, suspend or terminate your ability to participate in a Rewards Program in its sole and absolute discretion, and may void any Coin, Rewards, or potential Rewards you may have earned or accumulated in a Rewards Program, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have not complied with these Terms or any Additional Terms applicable to such participation. <br><br>You agree to abide by the final and binding decisions of the Company regarding any Rewards Program and your participation in it. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or cancel all or a portion of a Rewards Program, including any Coin you may have accrued, at any time. We will generally use reasonable efforts to provide notice to you of any material change to or a suspension or cancellation of a Rewards Program. <br><br>Coin can be earned in a Rewards Program by participating in certain Activities, as described in the Faceflyer Site and Features. If you choose to participate and follow the instructions associated with an Activity, upon satisfying all of the requirements of the Activity, you will be awarded the Coin associated with completing that Activity so long as the Company and/or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates are able to properly track your valid and completed coin-earning Activities. For avoidance of doubt, Company shall not be responsible for, nor shall Company be obligated to award coin or Rewards to Rewards Program participants for, any Activity that is not properly recorded, tracked and/or deemed approved under Company’s or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates’ policies, procedures and systems, and any coin or Rewards previously granted may be revoked in appropriate circumstances.<br><br> There may be limitations on Activities and Rewards, so please be sure to review all applicable Additional Terms before deciding whether or not you would like to participate. For example, we reserve the right to request and verify receipts of completed purchases prior to or in connection with the awarding of coin for shopping Activities in order to verify with the applicable merchant that such purchases are valid. You agree that we may also contact you by phone, SMS or text (including using an automated dialing system) for the purpose of verifying transactions and/or avoiding potential fraud or misuse of our Faceflyer Sites and Features.  Some of the limitations on Activities and rewards include (without limitation), our right to change or limit your ability to participate in certain Activities or the Rewards Program itself; our right to change or limit the allowable frequency of Activities; our right to change or limit the number of coin you can earn for a given Activity or during a given time period; and our right to change the Activities or Rewards available, or the number of coin required for a particular reward.<br><br> Coin awarded have no cash value. Redeeming Coin You may redeem points you have earned for Rewards offered in a Rewards Program pursuant to these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms. Supplies may be limited. Rewards may be awarded on a first-come, first-serve and while-supplies-last basis. If you attempt to redeem points for a Reward and the Company determines that the Reward is unavailable, out of stock, or for whatever reason cannot be provided to you, the Company may, at its sole and absolute discretion, provide you with a Reward of equal or greater value. No credit, reversal, or refund of coin will be issued for any reason after coin have been redeemed; in other words, once you order a Reward, you may not cancel the Reward or return the Reward for a refund of coin. The only way to use coin is to redeem them for Rewards Program Rewards as available from time to time through the faceflyer.com Rewards Store at https://www.faceflyer.com/shop, or other applicable Rewards Program redemption sites, as applicable. Some Rewards may have eligibility requirements and in that case the Company reserves the right to verify your identity (by requesting photocopy of your driver’s licence or state ID card, or other proof as we may require) and eligibility qualifications to our complete satisfaction prior to crediting coin or fulfilling any Reward in any Rewards Program, or otherwise providing you with any benefit.<br><br> Delivery of Rewards Rewards may be emailed to your email address that you provided when you registered and created an account (“Account“) for the applicable Rewards Program, or to the email that our records show your Account was last updated to reflect. Processing times may vary. Rewards that are undeliverable or unclaimed for whatever reason (including, without limitation, because your Account information is incorrect or outdated) may be forfeited, and the coin will not be refunded. Rewards Program Coin Nontransferable Rewards Program coin are non-transferable, may not be bartered or sold, and are void if a transfer is attempted, and such coin and the associated Account are not transferable upon death, as part of a domestic relations matter or otherwise by operation of law. Inactive Accounts Any Account that has not been logged into and coin either earned or redeemed for one year or more may be deemed inactive and the Account closed. We may either close the Account completely or remove any coin in the Account and treat it as inactive, as we elect.  In such instances, to request Account reactivation (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time) you may reach us by using the “Contact Us” link in the footer of the Faceflyer Site or Features. We may modify the foregoing inactive Account rules and policies in our Rewards Programs from time to time. Points Expiration Any coin in our Rewards Programs that have not been redeemed for two (2) years from the time such coin were earned or awarded may be deemed expired and removed from your Account. In such instances, to request re-crediting of the expired coin to the Account (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time) you can reach us by using the “Contact Us” link in the footer of the Faceflyer Site or Features. We may modify the foregoing points expiration rules and policies for any points in our Rewards Programs from time to time.</p>
